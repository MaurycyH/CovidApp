# CovidApp
The application was created in Xamarin.Forms in order to train my skills in C #. 
I wrote the entire application myself. I tried to keep the MVVM pattern throughout the entire application structure.
It uses the local SQLite database and the [Xamarin.Forms.GoogleMaps](https://github.com/amay077/Xamarin.Forms.GoogleMaps) nuget package
